Workflow for a Standalone Photo Sorting System

This system will allow users to upload photos, automatically detect & cluster faces, and retrieve images based on faces or names.

---

ðŸ“Œ Step 1: User Uploads Photos

Users upload single or multiple photos through a web interface.

The system stores images locally or in cloud storage (e.g., Firebase, AWS S3, or a local directory).

Store image metadata (e.g., filename, upload date) in a database.

ðŸ›  Tech: React.js (Frontend), Django/FastAPI (Backend), PostgreSQL/MongoDB (Database)

---

ðŸ“Œ Step 2: Face Detection & Feature Extraction

Once an image is uploaded, the backend detects faces using OpenCV or Mediapipe.

Extract face embeddings (numerical representation of faces) using FaceNet, DeepFace, or Dlib.

Store face embeddings in the database along with the image reference.

ðŸ›  Tech: OpenCV, FaceNet/DeepFace, Python

---

ðŸ“Œ Step 3: Face Clustering & Name Assignment

Group similar faces using K-Means or DBSCAN clustering.

Users can assign names to clusters (e.g., "John", "Mom").

Once a name is assigned, all matching faces are labeled automatically.

ðŸ›  Tech: Scikit-Learn (DBSCAN/K-Means), DeepFace

---

ðŸ“Œ Step 4: Image Sorting & Retrieval

Users can search for a person by name.

The system retrieves all photos where that person's face appears.

Provide filters (date, location, etc.).

ðŸ›  Tech: SQL queries for search, FastAPI/Django API

---

ðŸ“Œ Step 5: Display & User Interaction

Display organized albums sorted by people.

Allow users to manually correct misclassified faces.

Option to delete or rename clusters.
